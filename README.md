- 👋 Hi, I’m @aawadallah-coursera
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring new technologies and programming languages, particularly in the context of Java, .NET and Golang. I'm also fascinated by emerging trends in software development, such as serverless computing and artificial intelligence. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, especially with Micronaut and Quarkus, being coming from the .NET world, it is a bit disorienting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on _search_ related activities
